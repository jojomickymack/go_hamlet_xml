## Parse XML With Go

You can parse XML with the standard Go library. This is an example of how that's done using an xml version of shakespeare's hamlet, which was aquired 
from [here](https://github.com/severdia/PlayShakespeare.com-XML).

I intended to use this as an exersize for sorting - but realized that when the lines are taken out of context the play is meaningless. That's why I'm 
reading all of the lines in order, maybe I'll find ways to sort them that retain the context of the lines.

This example is probably helpful for anyone trying to parse xml with go.
